            <h3>PCHELICHKA</h3>
            <p>
              PCHELICHKA is an autonomous drone-bee, built as a continuation of
              my research. I came up with an innovative end effector for
              pollination without damaging the plant, and designed and tuned the
              control strategy, while my partner provided the hardware. This is
              an early prototype video:
            </p>

            ></iframe>
            <p>
              The drone uses only its camera feed, received over a digital
              wireless link, and inertial measurement unit for navigation and
              stabilization. The motors are controlled with a cascading PID
              controller from position to velocity to acceleration to pitch,
              roll, and yaw rate commands, which are then sent to the drone
              through the FPV radio.
              <b>The drone is entirely autonomous form lift-off to landing.</b>

            />
            <p>
              I also built this dashboard for management of the system. It
              allows for easy setup of the drone and an interface to the AI I
              trained. The computer vision model takes images from the camera
              feed and looks for signs of diseases on the plants to alert the
              user of threats to yield.

              communication range. I further built a simulation environment for
              its evaluation and compared its effectiveness to other approaches

              I am a co-founder of the only Bulgarian FRC team
              <b>ACS Phoenix #9089</b>. We have been participating in the
              competition since the 2023 season, and I captained the team during
              the 2024 and 2025 seasons.

              For the 2025 season, I grew the team to over 30 people with a
              $10,000 budget, and we secured a playoff spot for the first time.
              On top of my organizational duties as captain, I took the lead on
              developing the elevator, arm, and intake mechanisms, as well as
              programming and autonomous routines.

              In 2024, I took over as captain and we became 25/51, compared to
              48/49 in 2023. I led our fundraising efforts, nearly tripling the
              team&apos;s budget from the previous year, while also developing
              the software and the intake mechanism.

              SHARO is a robot dog I built again with a partner. I was mainly
              responsible for the software of the robot, which was built from
              scratch. I came up with a novel way to define the motion of its
              limbs with Bézier curves.

              I also integrated computer vision models for facial detection and
              emotion classification, which made it particularly engaging for
              kids at various events. To fit all the code on a Raspberry Pi 4, I
              optimized the code with multiprocessing and moved the inverse
              kinematics calculations to Rust.

              I was contacted by a local chain of paintball arenas to create a

              fabricated a total of 5 "checkpoints".

              An esp32 is the "brain" of each checkpoint and controls 2

              powers the entire system, and the esp32 through a step-down
              converter. The checkpoints are wirelessly set up before play and
              measure the duration that each team controls the checkpoint,
              producing a winner at the end. They are also able to sync with
              each other through a dedicated NRF24L01+ radio.

              I attended a 5-week-long summer bootcamp where along with a
              rigorous academic program, consisting of daily lectures and weekly
              survival quizzes, we were separated into teams with the task of
              building ground stations to communicate with a real satellite.

              I was the team captain and mainly focused on the electroncis and

              satellite tracker with Rust that automatically started the station
              when a satellite pass is occuring. In the end, we were awarded for
              best project documentation and I was among the few to successfully
              graduate the bootcamp.
